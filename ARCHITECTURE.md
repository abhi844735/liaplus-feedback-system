# User Feedback System Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The Feedback System follows a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns and makes the codebase maintainable and scalable.

## System Design

### Frontend Architecture

The React frontend follows a component-based architecture with the following key elements:

1. **Pages**: High-level components that represent full views (Dashboard, FeedbackForm)
2. **Components**: Reusable UI elements that can be composed together
3. **Services**: Modules that handle API communication and data transformation
4. **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared behavior and state management

#### Key Frontend Components:

- **Header**: Navigation bar component with links to different sections
- **FeedbackForm**: Form for submitting feedback with validation
- **Dashboard**: Interactive view for exploring and filtering feedback
- **API Service**: Centralized service for all API calls

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a Service-Repository pattern to separate business logic from data access:

1. **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
2. **Services**: Contain business logic and orchestration
3. **Repositories**: Responsible for data access and database operations
4. **Models**: Define database schemas and document structure
5. **Routes**: Define API endpoints and connect them to controllers

### Data Flow

#### Feedback Submission Flow

1. User fills out the feedback form on the frontend
2. Frontend validates input and sends a POST request to `/api/feedback`
3. Controller receives the request and passes data to the service layer
4. Service layer validates and processes the data
5. Repository layer saves the data to MongoDB
6. Response flows back through the layers to the frontend
7. UI updates to show success message

```
User → FeedbackForm → API Service → Controller → Service → Repository → MongoDB
                                                                        ↓
User ← FeedbackForm ← API Service ← Controller ← Service ← Repository ← MongoDB
```

#### Feedback Retrieval Flow with Filtering

1. User interacts with filters on the Dashboard
2. Frontend collects filter parameters and sends a GET request to `/api/feedback` with query parameters
3. Controller extracts query parameters and passes them to the service
4. Service prepares filtering criteria and calls the repository
5. Repository builds and executes a MongoDB query with the filters
6. Results flow back through the layers to the frontend
7. Dashboard updates to display the filtered results

```
User → Dashboard → API Service → Controller → Service → Repository → MongoDB
                                                                    ↓
User ← Dashboard ← API Service ← Controller ← Service ← Repository ← MongoDB
```

#### Mock Data Generation Flow

1. User clicks "Load Mock Data" button
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/seed/mock`
3. Seed controller calls the seed service
4. Seed service clears existing data and inserts predefined mock entries
5. Response returns to frontend
6. Dashboard refreshes to show the new data

## Database Design

### MongoDB Collections

#### Feedback Collection

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,        // User's name
  email: String,       // User's email
  feedbackText: String, // The actual feedback
  category: String,    // Enum: ['Suggestion', 'Bug Report', 'Feature Request', 'Other']
  createdAt: Date      // Timestamp
}
```

### Indexing Strategy

To optimize performance, we've implemented the following indexes:

- `createdAt`: For efficient date-based sorting
- `category`: For quick filtering by category
- Text indexes on `name`, `email`, and `feedbackText` for search functionality

## Key Technical Features

### Server-Side Search Implementation

The server implements text search across multiple fields using MongoDB's `$regex` operator:

```javascript
if (searchTerm) {
  filter.$or = [
    { name: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
    { email: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
    { feedbackText: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } }
  ];
}
```

### Automatic Server Restart with Nodemon

Development workflow is optimized with nodemon configuration:

```json
"dev": "nodemon --watch './**/*.js' server.js"
```

### Filter Synchronization

The frontend and backend work together to implement efficient filtering:

1. Frontend collects all filter parameters (search, category, sort)
2. Parameters are sent to the backend in a single request
3. Backend applies all filters simultaneously in a single database query
4. Results are returned with pagination information

### One-Click Demo Data

The mock data feature allows for instant data population:

1. Frontend provides a "Load Mock Data" button
2. Backend handles clearing existing data and loading samples
3. Predefined data covers various categories and time periods

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed with scalability in mind:

1. **Pagination**: All data retrieval implements pagination to handle large datasets
2. **Efficient Queries**: Indexes and query optimization minimize database load
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clean architecture allows for easy expansion
4. **Environment Configuration**: External configuration for different environments

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the system architecture:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: User accounts with role-based access
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live feedback notifications
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Aggregated metrics and insights from feedback data
4. **Export Functionality**: Export feedback data to various formats (CSV, Excel)
5. **Admin Features**: Administrative tools for feedback management
